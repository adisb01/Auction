# Auction
A simple functioning mock-auction web application that supports registering for an account, listings items, closing listed items, favoriting items, and bidding (with fake money). It was made using Django for the backend with its built in SQLite database. To access the site on a local machine, clone the project, cd into the project, and run "python manage.py runserver" in the commandline. Use the URL provided to then visit the site. This project was for Harvard's CS50 Web Programming for Python and Javascript, but only the inital Django setup was provided to start with.
